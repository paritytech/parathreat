# Parathreat

## Introduction

Parathreat is a wargame centered on securing the Polkadot SDK ecosystem, offering an array of missions for participants to navigate and conquer. With the initial mission ready for engagement and more on the horizon, the game covers extensive aspects of the Polkadot ecosystem, including parachains, pallets, and nodes within the Substrate framework. Participants are tasked with identifying and rectifying security vulnerabilities across these diverse components, mirroring the real-world scenarios of threat detection and resolution.

### Gameplay Modes

This wargame is designed with two distinct gameplay modes, each emphasizing a different facet of cybersecurity within the Polkadot SDK environment:

- **Red Team Mode:** Tailored for those seeking an intensive challenge, this mode equips players with targets and basic exploits. The goal is to customize and deploy these exploits against the provided targets. Success in Red Team mode requires not only discovering vulnerabilities but also creatively leveraging them, reflecting the tactics of attackers intent on compromising network defenses.

- **Blue Team Mode:** Offering a slightly more approachable level of difficulty, Blue Team mode presents players with the same targets alongside active threat scripts that are currently exploiting these targets. Players must analyze these attacks to pinpoint vulnerabilities and develop effective countermeasures, adopting the role of defenders tasked with protecting the network against threats.

## What You Can Expect to Learn

Parathreat equips you with insights and skills relevant to the Polkadot SDK ecosystem:

- **Understanding Polkadot SDK Security Risks:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of potential security risks within the Polkadot SDK, including common vulnerabilities that could compromise parachains and the broader Substrate framework.
- **Identifying Vulnerabilities:** Learn how to meticulously scan and identify weaknesses within the Polkadot ecosystem, utilizing systematic approaches to uncover potential threats.
- **Exploiting and Mitigating Threats:** Master the art of exploiting identified vulnerabilities to understand their implications, followed by developing and implementing robust mitigation strategies to safeguard the ecosystem.
- **Enhancing Development and Auditing Skills:** Whether you aspire to excel as a developer or auditor within the Polkadot ecosystem, Parathreat offers a hands-on learning experience to refine your abilities, ensuring you are well-equipped to contribute to the security and integrity of the Polkadot SDK.

## Getting Started

Ideal for individuals with foundational knowledge of the Substrate framework and an interest in cybersecurity, Parathreat challenges you to think both offensively and defensively, enhancing your proficiency in securing the Polkadot ecosystem.
